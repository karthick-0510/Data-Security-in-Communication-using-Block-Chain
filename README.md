# Data-Security-in-Communication-using-Block-Chain

This project used to secure the satellite data using block chain and safe accessing of data.

Satellite communication plays a vital role in developing global communication networks. It has recently gained attention as a solution to the limitations of terrestrial networks, which suffer from reduced stability and coverage. However, satellite communication faces challenges such as low data processing capacity, limited storage, and weak security. Illegal access has become a major concern. Due to physical constraints like limited power and area, satellites struggle with data processing and security, making them vulnerable to data alteration or intrusion. To address these issues, this project proposes a satellite communication network using blockchain technology and the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol for authentication and privacy. The architecture includes both traditional and resource constrained devices connected via a wireless heterogeneous network. Communication involves registration, authentication, and revocation processes. The satellite sends data to the terrestrial base station, which logs key parameters on the distributed blockchain and removes rogue node certificates. This proposed system enhances security for 6G and beyond networks, IoT, autonomous vehicles, and other advanced applications.
